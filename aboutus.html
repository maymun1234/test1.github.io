    <p>RetroSupply Co. was founded in 2012 by Dustin Lee, a nostalgia-loving graphic designer after discovering how difficult it was to achieve analog effects in his work.

      Scanning textures, making brushes, and trying to nail old school effects for a few hours each day, quickly turned into an obsession.
      
      Over the years, RetroSupply Co. has grown into an industry leader, providing over 100 products that help professional creatives unlock their potential and easily deliver beautiful results.
      
      With over 140,000 happy customers served worldwide and a full-time team of creatives, RetroSupply Co. continues to innovate its product line in order to provide the best possible experience for our customers.
